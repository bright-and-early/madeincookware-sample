## Sample

This is a [next.js](https://nextjs.org) starter app for showing an array of randomly generated items.

* Please try to not take much more than an hour to complete the task
* You are free to download this repo instead of branching off of it and making a private repo so it's not visible. If you do so, please invite @laugharn and @threesam to have read access
* We have git ignored lockfiles, so use the package manager of your choice (npm, pnpm, or yarn)

These are the requirements for the product cards:

* Go to pages/index.js and, using Tailwind, vanilla CSS, or a library of your choice, render out twelve product cards using the products data array
* The products should be ordered by price, from highest to lowest
* Each card needs to display the title and price of the product
* If a product is **not sold out**, it should show an orange button that says "Add to Cart" that when clicked, alerts `${product.id} was added to your cart`
* Any additional styling you want to do with the data provided is up to you, but embellishment is encouraged

When you have completed the assignment, please connect with your contact at Made In to continue the process.
